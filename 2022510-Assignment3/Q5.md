To implement load balancing with `iptables` at the **Gateway VM** based on the probability of assigning packets to each server, follow these steps:

### (a) Load Balancing Configuration with Probability-Based Routing

Since you've measured the RTT in the previous question (Q3.b) and identified which server has the lower RTT, configure `iptables` to balance traffic with probabilities of 0.8 and 0.2 for `40.1.1.1/24` and `40.1.1.3/24`, respectively. 

1. **Add an `iptables` Rule for the Server with Lower RTT (High Probability):**

   Assuming `40.1.1.1` has the lower RTT and should receive 80% of the traffic, use the `-m statistic --mode random --probability` option to control the probability of matching packets.

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s 20.1.1.1/24 -m statistic --mode random --probability 0.8 -j DNAT --to-destination 40.1.1.1
   ```

   - This rule will direct 80% of incoming packets from `20.1.1.1/24` to `40.1.1.1`.

2. **Add an `iptables` Rule for the Server with Higher RTT (Lower Probability):**

   For the remaining 20% of traffic to go to `40.1.1.3`, add a second rule without specifying a probability. This rule will match packets that didn't match the first rule.

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -s 20.1.1.1/24 -j DNAT --to-destination 40.1.1.3
   ```

   - This rule will direct the remaining 20% of traffic to `40.1.1.3`.

3. **Verify `iptables` Rules:**

   To verify the rules, list them using:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -L -v -n
   ```

### (b) Testing the Load Balancing Configuration with Ping

1. **Send a Series of Ping Packets:**

   From the **Client VM** (20.1.1.1), run a series of `ping` commands to a target IP address (e.g., the original IP that routes through the **Gateway VM**). This will test the load balancing setup.

   ```bash
   ping -c 20 40.1.1.1
   ```

   - Since NAT rules are applied, traffic should be balanced between `40.1.1.1` and `40.1.1.3` based on the configured probabilities.

2. **Observe the Distribution of Packets:**

   - On the **Gateway VM**, use `tcpdump` to observe which server each packet is directed to:
     ```bash
     sudo tcpdump -i ens36 host 40.1.1.1 or host 40.1.1.3
     ```

   - This should show that approximately 80% of packets are routed to `40.1.1.1`, while the remaining 20% are routed to `40.1.1.3`.

3. **Screenshot:** Capture screenshots of the `iptables` rules showing the probability configuration, the `ping` command output on the **Client VM**, and `tcpdump` results on the **Gateway VM** that demonstrate the packets being distributed according to the 80:20 probability.
