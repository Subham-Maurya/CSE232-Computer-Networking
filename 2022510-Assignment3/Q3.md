To complete Q3, follow these steps:

### (a) Test TCP and UDP Bandwidth Using `iperf2`

1. **Install `iperf2` on Both Client (20.1.1.1) and Server (40.1.1.3):**
   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install iperf
   ```

2. **Start `iperf2` Server on 40.1.1.3 (Server2):**
   ```bash
   iperf -s -i 1
   ```
   This will start the `iperf2` server, which will listen for incoming bandwidth test connections.

3. **Run TCP Bandwidth Test from Client (20.1.1.1):**
   On the **Client VM**, initiate a TCP bandwidth test to `40.1.1.3`:
   ```bash
   iperf -c 40.1.1.3 -i 1 -t 10
   ```
   This will measure the TCP bandwidth for 10 seconds. 

4. **Run UDP Bandwidth Test from Client (20.1.1.1):**
   To test UDP bandwidth, run the following command on the **Client VM**:
   ```bash
   iperf -c 40.1.1.3 -u -b 10M -i 1 -t 10
   ```
   This tests UDP bandwidth with a 10 Mbps limit for 10 seconds.

5. **Screenshot:** Capture the output on the **Client VM** showing the TCP and UDP bandwidth results.

### (b) Measure RTT (Round-Trip Time) with `ping`

1. **Ping from 20.1.1.1 to 40.1.1.1 (i):**
   ```bash
   ping -c 10 40.1.1.1
   ```

   - **Interpretation:** The `-c 10` option sends 10 pings, and the output will show minimum, average, and maximum RTT values at the end.
   - **Screenshot:** Capture the output showing RTT statistics.

2. **Ping from 20.1.1.1 to 40.1.1.3 (ii):**
   ```bash
   ping -c 10 40.1.1.3
   ```

   - **Screenshot:** Capture the output showing RTT statistics.

3. **Analysis (iii):**
   Compare the RTT values between **20.1.1.1 -> 40.1.1.1** and **20.1.1.1 -> 40.1.1.3**:
   
   - **Expected Difference:** If there's a significant difference, it could be due to load balancing configurations, network path differences, or potential packet filtering rules that could influence latency.
