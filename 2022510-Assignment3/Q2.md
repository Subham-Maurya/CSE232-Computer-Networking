To implement traffic filtering at the gateway VM, you can use `iptables` rules to allow or block specific types of traffic.

### (a) Block All Traffic Except Ping to Server `40.1.1.1/24`

1. **Allow ICMP (Ping) Traffic to Server `40.1.1.1/24`:**

   Run this command on the **Gateway VM** (VM2) to allow ICMP traffic:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -d 40.1.1.1/24 -p icmp -j ACCEPT
   ```

2. **Block All Other Traffic to Server `40.1.1.1/24`:**

   Run this command to drop any other traffic destined for `40.1.1.1/24`:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -d 40.1.1.1/24 -j DROP
   ```

3. **Verify the Configuration:**

   - **Test with Ping:** From the **Client VM** (20.1.1.1), use the `ping` command to `40.1.1.1` and ensure it works.
     ```bash
     ping 40.1.1.1
     ```
   - **Test with Other Traffic (e.g., HTTP or SSH):** Try initiating an HTTP or SSH connection to `40.1.1.1` from the **Client VM**. It should fail.

   **Screenshot:** Capture a screenshot showing the `ping` command working, and any other type of connection attempt (like `ssh`) failing.

### (b) Block Only TCP Traffic Initiated by `20.1.1.1/24`

1. **Block TCP Traffic from `20.1.1.1/24`:**

   Run this command on the **Gateway VM** to drop TCP traffic initiated by `20.1.1.1/24`:
   ```bash
   sudo iptables -A FORWARD -s 20.1.1.1/24 -p tcp -j DROP
   ```

2. **Verify the Configuration:**

   - **Test TCP Traffic:** On the **Client VM**, attempt to establish a TCP connection (e.g., SSH) to either `40.1.1.1` or `40.1.1.3`. This should fail.
     ```bash
     ssh user@40.1.1.1
     ```
   - **Test Non-TCP Traffic (like Ping):** Verify that `ping` commands to `40.1.1.1` and `40.1.1.3` still work.

   **Screenshot:** Capture a screenshot showing TCP connections failing (e.g., SSH) while ICMP (ping) still works.
