To implement Network Address Translation (NAT) for this setup, you can use `iptables` on the **Gateway VM (20.1.1.2)** to achieve source NAT (SNAT) and destination NAT (DNAT) as specified in the question.

Hereâ€™s how to configure each part:

### (a) Change the Source IP Address of Every Packet from `20.1.1.1/24` to `40.1.1.2/24`

1. Use `iptables` to modify the source IP of packets coming from `20.1.1.1/24` and going through the **Gateway VM** to have the source IP `40.1.1.2`:

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 20.1.1.1/24 -j SNAT --to-source 40.1.1.2
   ```

   - This rule in the `POSTROUTING` chain of the `nat` table will change the source IP of outgoing packets from `20.1.1.1` to `40.1.1.2`.

### (b) Revert the Destination IP Address to the Original when the Response Arrives

1. To revert the destination IP back to `20.1.1.1` for incoming responses, add a rule for DNAT in the **PREROUTING** chain:

   ```bash
   sudo iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -d 40.1.1.2 -j DNAT --to-destination 20.1.1.1
   ```

   - This rule will ensure that incoming packets with destination `40.1.1.2` get their destination address rewritten to `20.1.1.1`.

### (c) Validate the Configuration

1. **Testing:** From the **Client VM (20.1.1.1)**, try sending traffic to one of the servers (e.g., `40.1.1.3`) using `ping`, `curl`, or `ssh` to observe the NAT behavior.

   For example, you can use `ping` or `curl` to generate traffic:
   ```bash
   ping 40.1.1.3
   ```

2. **Observing the NAT:** On the **Gateway VM**, you can use the following commands to observe packet changes:

   - Use `iptables -t nat -L -v -n` to view the NAT rules and see packet counts.
   - Use `tcpdump` to capture packets on the **Gateway VM** and observe the changes in IP addresses:
     ```bash
     sudo tcpdump -i ens34 src 20.1.1.1 or dst 20.1.1.1
     ```

3. **Screenshot:** Capture screenshots of your `iptables` configuration and packet captures (e.g., using `tcpdump`) that show the source IP being changed to `40.1.1.2` and then reverted when the response arrives.
